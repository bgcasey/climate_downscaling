Here we present our workflow and code for refining ClimateNA temperature predictions using temperature data loggers and remote sensing data accessed via Google Earth Engine. Temperature offset layers and project spatial data can be viewed at <https://bgcasey.users.earthengine.app/view/climateoffsets>.

Ecological studies often rely on interpolated climate data to predict species distributions and identify climate change refugia. However, the scale of climate data does not always correspond to the scale of habitat conditions influencing organisms. ClimateNA, a freely available software package, addresses this by providing scale-free predictions of climate variables by interpolating gridded climate data and adjusting for elevation. While useful, ClimateNA predictions could be improved by incorporating other variables that influence micro-climatic variation. We developed methods to refine ClimateNA air temperature predictions using temperature data loggers and remote sensing data accessed via Google Earth Engine. Monthly temperature variables from 2005-2021 were calculated using near-surface temperatures gathered from 513 monitoring sites across Alberta, Canada. We used variables associated with terrain, vegetation structure, and atmospheric conditions in boosted-regression trees to predict differences between ClimateNA temperature predictions and micro-climate conditions. We produced 30 m seasonal offset layers for mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures covering all of Alberta and British Columbia. Mean summer temperatures were on average -0.03°C (SD = 0.71) greater than ClimateNA predictions; maximum summer temperatures were on average 6.81°C (SD = 1.11) less than CimateNA predictions; and winter minimum temperatures were on average -0.81°C (SD = 0.98) greater than CimateNA predictions. Offset adjusted ClimateNA predictions should better reflect micro-climatic variation and improve the accuracy of species-habitat models.

```{r GlobalOptions, echo=FALSE}
options(bookdown.render.file_scope = FALSE, knitr.duplicate.label = "allow") 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache.path = "5_cache/")
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file())
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
#Set root directory to R project root
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file())
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)
library(readxl)
```

# Import and clean temperature data

First we gathered temperature data from temperature data loggers deployed across the province of Alberta.

```{r covDes, echo=FALSE}
iButton_sources <- read_excel("0_data/iButton_sources.xlsx")

kable(iButton_sources, format="simple", caption = ' Sources of temperature data loggers.')
```

The file `1_code/r_notebooks/1_ibutton_data_prepare.Rmd` provides code and instructions for importing and cleaning data from both raw and processed iButton temperature data. We did the following for each source of iButton data:

1.  Imported temperature data into the r project.
2.  Identified and removed pre-deployment and post-retrieval temperature data.
3.  Identified and fixed errors in date-time strings.
4.  Identified and fixed errors in iButton site names and made sure that each iButton deployment was associated with a unique identifier.
5.  Calculated daily temperature summaries including:
    -   **Tmax (maximum temperature)**

    -   **Tmin (minimum temperature)**

    -   **Tavg (mean temperature)**
6.  Combined daily temperature data from all sources into a single data frame.

# Get XY coordinates of data loggers

The file `1_code/r_notebooks/2_ibutton_data_xy.Rmd` provides code and instructions for generating spatial dataframes and shapefiles of iButton locations in R. We:

1.  Get XY coordinates of iButton locations.
2.  Convert data frame with coordinates to a spatial dataframe using the `sf` package [@R-sf].
3.  Export as a shape file. The shape file will of point locations was later uploaded as an asset to Google Earth Engine and used to extract environmental variables.
4.  Create a map of the study area using the `tmap` package in R [@R-tmap].

```{r studyArea, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Locations of temperature data loggers.", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("3_output/maps/ss_xy.png")
```

# Temperature data quality control

The file `1_code/r_notebooks/3_ibutton_qualityControl.Rmd` provides code and instructions for flagging outlier temperature data and identify iButtons that were grounded or covered by snow during their deployment. Once outliers were flagged and removed, we interpolated missing temperature data, and calculated monthly temperature metrics (Tmax, Tmin, and Tavg). The markdown file describes the following steps:

1.  Remove the first and last months of a temperature time series if it only had 20 days or less of data.
2.  Indentify temperature outliers by calculating the difference the daily temperature metrics we calculated and daily temperature estimates from ERA5 [@hersbach2018era5]. We flagged and iButton data with temperature differences that were above (Mean + 3\**SD*) and temperature differences below (Mean - 3\**SD*)
3.  Impute missing data with a maximum gap of 10 days useing the `na_interpolation` function in the r package `imputeTS` [@imputeTS2017].
4.  Flag iButtons that may have been buried by snow. An iButton was flagged as buried if it had diurnal temperature range of \<3 degrees for 25 consequetive days or more [@wood2017dtdf].
5.  Calculate monthly temperature summaries.
6.  Exclude months with more than 10 missing or flagged days from our data set.

```{r echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, results="asis"}
load("0_data/manual/iButton_data/ibuttons_complete_monthly.rData")

ibuttons_complete_monthly<-ibuttons_complete_monthly%>%mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 3))

knitr::kable(head(ibuttons_complete_monthly), "pipe") 
```

# ClimateNA temperature

The file `1_code/r_notebooks/4_ibutton_climatesNA.Rmd` provides instructions for:

1.  Installing the ClimateNA desktop application and r package [@wang2016locally].
2.  Extracting monthly ClimateNA temperature predictions for each iButton location.
3.  Calculating difference between monthly iButton and ClimateNA temperature metrics.

```{r echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, results="asis"}
load("0_data/manual/iButton_data/iButton_cNA_diff.rData")

iButton_cNA_diff<-iButton_cNA_diff%>%mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 3))

knitr::kable(head(iButton_cNA_diff), "pipe") 
```

# Spatial covariates

Spatial covariates were extracted using Google Earth Engine's online code editor at [code.earthengine.google.com](http://code.earthengine.google.com/).

Download the Google Earth Engine script by using `git clone https://earthengine.googlesource.com/users/bgcasey/climate_downscaling` into your working directory. Earth engine sripts are also contained as .js files in `1_code/GEE/`. Just copy them them into the Google Earth online code editor.

The file `1_code/r_notebooks/5_covariates_gee_spatial.Rmd` provides code for:

1.  Cloning the GEE git file and copying the projects .js files.
2.  Importing csv files of the summarized covariates generated in Google Earth Engine.
3.  Importing and processing raster layers for each covariate (generated in Google Earth Engine).
4.  Setting up data for use in boosted regression trees.

We calculated/extracted the following metrics in Google Earth Engine:

```{r covDes, echo=FALSE}
covariate_list<- read_excel("0_data/covariate_list.xlsx", sheet="Sheet2")

# kable(covariate_list, format="simple", caption = 'Spatial covariates evaluated and used in our analysis.')%>%
#     kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))

kbl(covariate_list, align = c("l", "l", "r", "r")) %>%
  kable_paper() %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T, width="5em") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "75em")%>%
  column_spec(3, width = "15em")

```
